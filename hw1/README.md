# HW1 Implementation Code

## Half Moon + Logistic Recognition 
- ``` Run 'python halfmoon.py' to execute the code
  - Matplotlib will generate a graph with the logistic regression to linearly separate the two classes generated by the half moon data

## Spambase + Naive Bayes Classifier + 5 Fold Cross Validation Error
- ``` Run 'python spambase.py' to execute the code
  - The code will read in the spambase csv file into a 2D array via pandas. Afterwhich sklearn will perofrm the naive bayes classifer using the gaussian library along with reporting the 5 fold cross validation error at the end to the console

## NOTE:
- This code was ran using python2.7 + anaconda distribution
