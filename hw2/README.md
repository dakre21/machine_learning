# HW2 Implementation Code

## Logistic Regression utilizing SGD Algorithm 
- ``` Run 'python logreg.py' to execute the code ```
  - Matplotlib will generate a graph with the logistic regression to linearly separate the two classes generated by data pulled from the 523 github
  - The logistic regression algorithm employs the SGD algorithm to minimize the function on the data and find the maximum margin between two classes of data points 

## Dimensionality Reduction 
- ``` Run 'python dimreduct.py' to execute the code ```
  - The code will read in a dataset from a csv file into a 2D array via pandas. After which I'll have two classifiers run against the data set which does not use a preprocessing step (i.e. feature selection or PCA) and report the accuracies of those models

## Density Estimation
- ``` Run 'python densest.py' to execute the code ```
  - This code will generate a checkerboard of data from two classes and employ a density estimator to classify the data. After the classification the code will plot the probability of 'x given y' or P(X|Y) using the density estimator

## NOTE:
- This code was ran using python2.7 + anaconda distribution
