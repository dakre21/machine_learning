# HW2 Implementation Code

## Logistic Regression utilizing SGD Algorithm 
- ``` Run 'python logreg.py' to execute the code ```
  - Matplotlib will generate a graph with the logistic regression to linearly separate the two classes generated by data pulled from the 523 github (i.e. wine.csv)
  - The logistic regression algorithm employs the SGD algorithm to minimize the function on the data and find the maximum margin between two classes of data points. The SGD algorithm will return a classifer used to help fit the linear model to the data at the end. Once the model is fit to the classifer value, I plot the scatter plot from the wine.csv to the general linear model in the form (1 / (1 + e^wt*x))

## Dimensionality Reduction 
- ``` Run 'python dimreduct.py' to execute the code ```
  - The code will read in a dataset from a csv file into a 2D array via pandas. After which I'll have two classifiers run against the data set which does not use a preprocessing step (i.e. feature selection or PCA) and report the accuracies of those models

## Density Estimation
- ``` Run 'python densest.py' to execute the code ```
  - This code will generate a checkerboard of data from two classes and employ a density estimator to classify the data. After the classification the code will plot the probability of 'x given y' or P(X|Y) using the density estimator

## NOTE:
- This code was ran using python2.7 + anaconda distribution
